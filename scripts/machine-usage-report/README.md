# 🖥️ Machine Usage Report – Python Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project simulates a **daily report system** for a medium-sized company.  
The goal is to track **which users are logged into which machines** at a given time using Python.  

It processes a list of **event objects** (logins and logouts) and generates a clean report of machine usage.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Sorts events in **chronological order**  
- Tracks logins and logouts using **dictionaries and sets**  
- Generates a report of active users per machine  
- Easily extendable for future improvements (CSV/PDF reports, GUI, or real-time tracking)

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Concepts Practiced  
- Python Classes & Objects  
- Sorting with custom keys  
- Dictionaries for mapping data  
- Sets for tracking unique users  
- Functions for clean code structure

## ✨ About This Project

This project was created as part of my **Python learning journey** to practice handling data, sorting, and reporting.
It’s a small but powerful step toward writing useful automation scripts.
