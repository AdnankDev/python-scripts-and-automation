# 🐍 Python Automation & Scripts Projects

Welcome to my collection of **Python projects, scripts, and automation tools**!  
This repository documents my **learning journey** and showcases practical solutions using Python.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here  
- 🔧 **Automation Scripts** – small tools to automate daily tasks  
- 📊 **Data Processing Projects** – handling, analyzing, and reporting data  
- 🖥️ **System Utilities** – scripts for file, log, or system management  
- 🎯 **Practice Projects** – mini-projects to sharpen Python skills

Each project has its own folder with:
- **Main script(s)**  
- **Sample data (if any)**  
- **Project-specific README**

## 🚀 Getting Started  
Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnankDev/python-automation-scripts-projects.git
````

Navigate into a project folder and run the script:

```bash
cd project-1-machine-usage-report
python machine_report.py
```

## 📊 Completed Projects

### 🔹 [Project 1: Machine Usage Report](./project-1-machine-usage-report/)

* Tracks which users are logged into which machines
* Processes **login/logout events** and generates a simple report
* Concepts used: **sorting, dictionaries, sets, functions**

✅ Example Output:

```
Machine-1: alice, bob
Machine-2: charlie
Machine-3: (no users)
```

## 🔮 Future Plans

* Add **new automation scripts** (file handling, web scraping, etc.)
* Expand existing projects (GUI, export to CSV/PDF, API integration)
* Document learnings and code snippets for reference
